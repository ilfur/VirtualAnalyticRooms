## number of containers to start, very often 1 is enough
replicaCount: 1

## container needs database access data, stored in a secret for better security
## please specify the name of the secret and which keys contain passwords, hostnames and so on.
## example values for the secret would be:
##
## apiVersion: v1
## kind: Secret
## stringData:
##   admin_pwd: myComplexPwd123
##   admin_user: sys
##   db_host: my.db.host.org
##   db_port: "1521"
##   db_servicename: FREEPDB1
##   proxy_pwd: oracle

secret:
  secretName: ords-secret
  adminUserKey: admin_user
  adminPwdKey: admin_pwd
  proxyUserPwdKey: proxy_pwd
  dbHostKey: db_host
  dbPortKey: db_port
  dbServiceKey: db_servicename

## at the moment this chart was created, the current version of ORDS was 24.3.0
## You could use container-registry.oracle.com/database/ords:24.3.0 or any other version here

## The network reachability of ORDS
## If you only need to call REST services from inside Your cluster, just use ClusterIP service type.
## If You have an ingress Gateway like istio or nginx, stay with ClusterIP but generate an Ingress
## If You would like to have ORDS to be directly addressed from outside, use LoadBalancer service type and no Ingress
## When using SSL, please specify a secret name which contains tls.crt and tls.key entries. 
## The tls.key MUST be PKCS8 format, the certificate can be X509.
## Please do not forget to use a Virtual Host Name that fits to Your certificate !
