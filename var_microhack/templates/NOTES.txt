Final NOTES:

Please wait about 2 Minutes for the source database to be completely up and loaded.

You can already try out Your sqlplus command line by using this URL in Your browser:
https://{{ .Values.services.external.vhostName }}/sqlplus/vnc.html

Alternatively, have a look at Your personal jupyter notebook:
https://{{ .Values.services.external.vhostName }}/jupyter/
Just enter the password "Welcome1234" when asked and then open the CPAT analysis notebook.

Once the DB is ready, GOldenGate Sync should be set up too. Check it out right here:

Have fun !
