Oracle Estate Explorer (OEE)
Oracle Estate Explorer is a tool that enables customers to
programmatically evaluate groups of Oracle databases for migration readiness to Oracle’s Autonomous Database (ADB). The output from OEE
provides a high-level estate overview of the tested group of databases, ranks them according to their alignment with ADB pre-requisites and
delivers a graded relative effort of any remediation required.

The OEE APEX app is installed in the adb-free images and is available to use out-of-the-box

Following steps are required to launch the OEE app:

Login as Database admin and set a password for the MPACK_OEE user
ALTER USER MPACK_OEE IDENTIFIED BY <password>
Visit the APEX URL using {{ .Values.database.dbname }}.{{ .Values.ingress.domainsuffix }}/ords/apex

Login to the MPACK_OEE APEX workspace using the password set in Step 1

Change the MPACK_OEE’s APEX account password. A warning page will be displayed after changing the MPACK_OEE’s APEX account password, please ignore it and click on Application Builder to launch the OEE application.

On the application home page, click “Run Application” to open the OEE app in a new browser tab.
